## Advanced Techniques in Python


## Questions:
1. **Question 1:**
    * Write a Python script that takes a list of student marks and sorts them in descending order (highest to lowest) using either the sorted() function or the .sort() method. 
    * File: [que1.py](que1.py)

2. **Question 2:**
    * Use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers between 1 and 20,demonstrating a more concise and readable alternative to traditional loops. 
    * File: [que2.py](que2.py)

3. **Question 3:**
    * Create a generator function using the yield keyword that produces numbers from 1 to 5 one by one to illustrate how lazy evaluation can save memory when dealing with large datasets. 
    * File: [que3.py](que3.py)

4. **Question 4:**
    * Write a Python script that takes a list of six student names and uses the random.sample() function to randomly select exactly three "Volunteers" for a presentation, ensuring that no student is picked more than once in the selection. 
    * File: [que4.py](que4.py)

5. **Question 5:**
    * Use the re module to write a script that searches through a paragraph and extracts all words that start with an uppercase letter (e.g., "London", "Python") to identify proper nouns or sentence starters.
    * File: [que5.py](que5.py) 

6. **Question 6:**
    * Given a list of student names and a list of their corresponding scores, use the zip() function to pair them together and then apply the reduce() function from the functools module to calculate the total sum of all scores.
    * File: [que6.py](que6.py)
