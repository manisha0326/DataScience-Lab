## Basics of Python, Data Types, Control Structures, Functions, and Loops
This repo covers the basics of python conditional statements, loops, functions, including input/output and basic problem-solving techniques. Each question is implements as a separate python program.

## Questions:
1. **Question 1: Sum of Two Numbers**
    * Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user, and print their sum.
    * File: [lab1\sum.py](lab1\sum.py)

2. **Question 2: Palindrome checker**
    * Write a program that checks if a given string is palindrome.
    * File: [lab1\pallindrome.py](lab1\pallindrome.py)

3. **Question 3: Prime Numbers upto n**
    * Write a program that prints all prime numbers up to a given number ‘n’.
    * File: [lab1\prime.py](lab1\prime.py)

4. **Question 4: Fibonacci Series**
    * Write a python program that prints the Fibonacci series up to n terms
    * File: [lab1\fibonacci.py](lab1\fibonacci.py)

5. **Question 5: GCD of two numbers**
    * Define a function that takes two numbers as arguments, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).
    * File: [lab1\gcd.py](lab1\gcd.py) 

6. **Question 6: Even or Odd Check**
    * Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.
    * File: [lab1\EvenOdd.py](lab1\EvenOdd.py)

7. **Question 7: Largest number in a list**
    * Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input, and returns the largest number in the list.
    * File: [lab1\larFromList.py](lab1\larFromList.py)

8. **Question 8: Leap year check**
    * Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year.
    * File: [lab1\LeapYear.py](lab1\LeapYear.py) 

9. **Question 9: Temperature Conversion**
    * Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, based on the choice of user.
    * File: [lab1\tempConversion.py](lab1\tempConversion.py)

10. **Question 10: Modular program using multiple python files**
    a. **Birth Year and Leap Year check**
        * A program that takes the age of an user, and gives their birth year, and if birth year was a leap year. 
        * File: [lab1\age.py](lab1\age.py)

    b. **BMI calculator**
        * A program that computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user, taking their height and weight as input. The program should allow the user to enter their height in either feet/inches or centimeters and their weight in either kilograms or pounds. Extend the program to convert BMI into a category based on standard criteria: 
            ■ Underweight: < 18.5 
            ■ Normal weight: 18.5 - 24.9 
            ■ Overweight: 25 - 29.9 
            ■ Obese: ≥ 30 

        * File: [lab1\bmi.py](lab1\bmi.py)

    c. **Army Entrance Eligibility check**
        * A program that checks if a user is eligible for army entrance based on their BMI and age. The eligibility criteria are as follows: 
            ■ Age must be between 18 and 40 years. 
            ■ BMI must be within the range of 18.5 to 29.9.

        * File: [lab1\army.py](lab1\army.py)

    **Main Program**
    File: [lab1\main.py](lab1\main.py)
