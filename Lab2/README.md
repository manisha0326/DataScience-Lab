# Lab 2
## Data Structures in Python


## Questions:
1. **Question 1: Movie Ratings Analyzer**
    * Ask the user to input a list of movies with ratings like [("Titanic", 8), ("Inception", 9), ...]. Compute the average rating, find the highest-rated movie, and list all movies with rating above the average. 

    * File: [MovieRating.py](MovieRating.py)

2. **Question 2: Unique Words Collector**
    * Take a paragraph input from the user. Split it into words, remove duplicates, sort them alphabetically, and count the total number of unique words.

    * File: [UniqueWord.py](UniqueWord.py)

3. **Question 3: Student Marks Manager**
    * Store student names as keys and marks (list of integers) as values in a dictionary. Compute each student’s average and grade (A/B/C/D). Print the top 2 students based on average marks.

    * File: [StudentMarkManager.py](StudentMarkManager.py)

4. **Question 4: Inventory Tracker**
    * Imagine a small store inventory like {"apple": 10, "banana": 5, "milk": 2}. Program should allow adding new items, selling items (subtract quantity), and print items that are low in stock (<3).

    * File: [InventoryTracker.py](InventoryTracker.py)

5. **Question 5: Word Reverser Game**
    * Ask the user for a list of words. Reverse each word only if its length is even. Print the new list of words after processing. 

    * File: [WordReverserGame.py](WordReverserGame.py) 

6. **Question 6: Simple Path Validator**
    * Represent a small map as a dictionary like {"A": {"B", "C"}, "B": {"A", "D"}, "C": {"A", "D"}, "D": {"B", "C"}}. Ask the user to input a path, e.g., ["A", "C", "D"]. Check if each consecutive step is connected and print "Valid path" or "Invalid path".

    * File: [SimplePathValidator.py](SimplePathValidator.py)
